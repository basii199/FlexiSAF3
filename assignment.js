console.log("Virtual DOM: A lightweight representation of the real DOM that React updates efficiently, improving performance.");

console.log("State: A built-in React object that holds dynamic data, triggering re-renders when updated. Managed in functional components with the useState hook.");

console.log("Props: Short for 'properties', props allow components to receive and pass data from parent to child. They are immutable.");

console.log("JSX: A syntax extension that lets you write HTML-like code inside JavaScript, making UI development more intuitive.");

console.log("Components: React components can be functional (using hooks) or class-based (using state and lifecycle methods). They help in building reusable UI elements.");

console.log("Lifecycle Methods: In class components, lifecycle methods (componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, etc.) control behavior at different stages. Functional components use the useEffect hook.");

console.log("Event Handlers: React uses camelCase event handlers (onClick, onChange, etc.) and manages events using functions or arrow functions.");
